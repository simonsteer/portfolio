  about: `My name is Simon Steer and I'm a web developer based in Toronto with a background in graphic design. You can typically find me rebuilding existing jQuery plugins or reading up on different web development-related skills (my current obsession is three.js). My passion towards web development drives me to create seamless, functional, and accessible web experiences.

  I'm constantly looking to better myself as a developer. Although there are many skills I have accumulated already, there is an infinite wealth of knowledge when it comes to web development. What inspires me to further my learning is the unknown; when I visit a website and I really have to think hard about how it was built, that excites me. My first instinct is to try and rebuild it myself and learn a new skill. I love being challenged, and will never settle or let my skills stagnate.

  When I'm not at the computer, I'm probably either at the gym, reading about intersectional politics, or playing video games on outdated consoles... But I'm usually at the computer.`
